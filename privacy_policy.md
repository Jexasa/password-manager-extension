# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: April 08, 2025*

## Overview
Password Manager is a Chrome extension designed to help you securely store and manage your passwords. Your privacy and security are our top priorities. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data—or rather, how we don’t.

## Data We Collect
- **No Personal Data Collected:** Password Manager operates entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information (e.g., usernames, passwords, or site data) to our servers or any third parties.
- **Local Storage:** All passwords and credentials you save are encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption and stored locally in your browser’s secure storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). Only you, with your master password, can access this data.
- **Analytics (Optional):** We may use anonymized usage statistics (e.g., number of passwords saved) via Google Analytics to improve the extension. This data does not include personal information and cannot be linked to you.

## How Your Data Is Used
Your encrypted passwords are used solely to provide the extension’s functionality: saving, retrieving, and autofilling credentials on websites you choose. The master password you set is never stored in plain text—it’s used to derive an encryption key locally and is cleared from memory after a short period of inactivity.

## Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to anyone. Since everything stays on your device, there’s nothing for us to share.

## Security
- We use industry-standard encryption (AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation) to protect your passwords.
- You are responsible for keeping your master password secure. If you forget it, we cannot recover your data, as we don’t have access to it.

## Third-Party Services
- **Google Analytics:** If enabled, anonymized usage data may be sent to Google Analytics. You can opt out by disabling analytics in future updates (if implemented).
- **Chrome Storage:** Your encrypted data is stored via Chrome’s sync feature, governed by Google’s privacy policies.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as the extension evolves. Check the Chrome Web Store listing for the latest version.
